# InvokeCompilerPass

As per [this website](http://blog.airesoft.co.uk/2013/01/plug-in-to-cls-kitchen/), other resources on the web and my own research one can plug into the MSVC toolchain via command line switches and a supplied DLL.

## License

Any third-party code (e.g. Lua and LuaVBidge3, fmtlib) obviously comes under its own respective licenses, the same goes for `ntnative.h` and `ntpebldr.h`; the remainder is under UNLICENSE, just like the rest of the project (docs etc. as well as the items outside of this subdirectory).
